# Window Edit 2.0

A Windows utility for managing, repositioning, and resizing open application windows. Great for rescuing off-screen windows or forcing any application into borderless fullscreen.

This is a full rewrite of my old project Window Edit from 2018.

## Features

- View all open windows, with an option to include invisible windows
- Double-click any window in the list to focus it
- View the executable path of the application that owns a window
- Move, resize, and control the state of any window
- Bring off-screen windows back to center
- Save window position profiles and apply them to any window
- Force any application into borderless fullscreen
- Close windows via the right-click context menu
- Undo any change with Ctrl+Z

## Borderless Fullscreen
The standout feature of Window Edit is the ability to make any application borderless fullscreen. This removes the title bar and window borders and stretches the window to fill your entire screen. This is great for older games that only support exclusive fullscreen or windowed mode.
